# hello-world
This repository is made for me to practice anything related to programming and information technology.
My name is Hell No I Ain't Telling,
AND right now I am a graduate student in the Master's of Information Technology program. Since I don't have a computers science or information technology backgroung, I am joining this site to teach me a little bit about programming. 
My goal is to become a software project manager, but first I need to learn what my subordinates will be doing.
